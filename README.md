ClassClips is a web application designed to help students stay organized and succeed by sharing and accessing class notes in one convenient place. 
Whether you're catching up on missed lectures, reviewing before a test, or just looking for a fresh perspective on the material — ClassClips makes it easier to learn collaboratively.
The platform is built to simplify studying and reduce stress by letting students upload their notes, browse others' notes, and explore helpful summaries. 
Our goal was to create a space that’s built for students, by students.

We know how challenging it can be to stay on top of all your classes — especially when juggling assignments, exams, and everyday life. 
ClassClips was built to make studying less isolating and more community-driven. 
The idea was to give students quick access to reliable, peer-generated notes so they can save time and study smarter.

Since this was our first time building a full project like this, it was tough to figure out where to start.
We solved that by dividing the work into smaller, clear tasks, which helped us stay organized and make steady progress.

Another challenge was integrating APIs into the project. It involved a lot of trial and error, debugging, and research to understand how all the 
backend and frontend components should work together — but once we cracked the flow, things started clicking.
We also worked hard to balance good design and smooth user experience. 
Keeping the UI clean, managing shared state across components, and making sure the site stayed scalable as new features were added pushed us to communicate and problem-solve as a team.

By the end of the project, we had built a working note-sharing platform that included key features like:

- AI-powered note summarization

- A like system to highlight helpful notes

- User authorization for secure logins and uploads

Beyond the code, the project taught us real-world skills: from version control and API integration to teamwork and troubleshooting. 
It was a rewarding process that helped us grow as developers and collaborators
